## Common Issues
â€‹
In some cases, when using Vite for your application, you may encounter a common issue related to the "504 (Outdated Optimize Dep)" error. To address this, you can modify the `vite.config.js` file by adding the following configuration:
1.  Import the `defineConfig` function from "vite":
   	```
		import { defineConfig } from "vite";
    ```
â€‹
2.  Update the default export to use `defineConfig` and include the `optimizeDeps` property:â€‹
```
		export default defineConfig({ 
		// ...
		optimizeDeps: {
		exclude: ['@reputex/vue-widget']
		}
		});
  ```
